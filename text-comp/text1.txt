From Corsicana the train on the Texas Central Railroad carried me
early straight south, leaving the valley of the Trinity and bearing
across the high country to the Brazos. Not one acre in ten of this
region is under fence. All the rest is common pasture, though most
of it belongs to private owners, and is for sale at two to six dol-
lars per acre. The region is high and gently undulating, about one-
fifth in timber, the rest fertile prairie. My next stopping place was
Houston, which I thought, at first view, the most beautiful place
in Texas. There had been a twenty-four-hoursâ€™ rain, and at 9 A. M
the sun shone out clear: the orange groves, magnolias, and shade
trees looked their richest green and Houston presented to the newly
arrived Northerner a most enchanting appearance. That city, the
original capital of Texas, is at the head of Buffalo Bayou, a long pro-
jection of Galveston Bay.
