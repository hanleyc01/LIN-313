What about Chicago? My dear good friend, what can I say about
that ninth wonder of the world which people everywhere do not
know already, and yet, something fresh may be squeezed out of it
at a few points. I found that it had a population of fully 2,000,000,
and was so immense in area, that once in it, you required some time
to get out of it, even by rail, or by swift tram cars, two of which
ran me one evening nearly twenty miles into the suburbs at a speed
of thirty miles an hour when possible. The country round about is
flat and uninteresting, but nevertheless, Chicago is a wonderful city
throughout, and of unique interest amongst the great cities of the
globe. The streets were as crowded as those of London, and the
shops quite as handsome, but I could not admire such an array of
gigantic commercial buildings, hundreds of feet in height, so much
alike, so slabby in form, and flat roofed in most cases.
