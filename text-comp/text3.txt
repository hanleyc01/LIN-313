One week sufficed to conclude my business in Oregon, but before
leaving a few general notes are in order. Portland is on the west bank
of the Willamette, twelve miles above its mouth and near the head
of tide-water. But the Columbia often rises so as to cause backwater,
giving the Willamette a variation of thirty-two feet. Ocean steamers
load at the wharf, and the place has direct water communication
with all the ports of the world, the chief exports being wheat, limber,
beef and salmon. All the older portion of the city is very beautifully
improved; elegant residences abound, with many evidences of taste
and wealth. The location is picturesque. The Cascade Range is only
occasionally visible, but Mount Hood rears its snowy summit sixty
miles eastward, and looks as if it were just out of town. Mount Saint
Helens is sometimes in good view, though eighty miles to the north-
east. All the hills around the city are covered with heavy timber, and
in town every street is double lined with shade trees.
