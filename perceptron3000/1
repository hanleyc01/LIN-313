/// The file format our simple neural network will work with.
///
/// Taken from [here](http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/ppm.html).
///
/// The PPM file format consists of the following:
///
/// 1. A "magic" number "P3"
/// 2. Whitespace (blanks, tabs, cr, lf's)
/// 3. Width, formatted as ASCII characters in decimal
/// 4. Whitespace
/// 5. A height (in ASCII decimal)
/// 6. Whitespace
/// 7. Maximum color value (Maxval) in ASCII decimal, must be 0 < c < 65536
/// 8. A single whitespace character (usually a \n)
/// 9. A raster of Height rows, in order from top to bottom. Each row consists of Width pixels
///    in order from left to right. Each pixel is a triplet of red, green, or blue samples (in
///    that order). Each sample is represented in pure binary by either 1 or 2 bytes. If the
///    Maxval is less than 256, it is 1 byte. Otherwise it is 2 bytes. The most significant byte
///    is first.
///
/// Example: (though this is of a PBM)
/// ```
/// P3
/// # feep.ppm
/// 4 4
/// 15
///  0  0  0    0  0  0    0  0  0   15  0 15
///  0  0  0    0 15  7    0  0  0    0  0  0
///  0  0  0    0  0  0    0 15  7    0  0  0
/// 15  0 15    0  0  0    0  0  0    0  0  0
