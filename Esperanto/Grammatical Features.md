# Notes on Grammatical Features of Esperanto

# Wikipedia Article
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto_grammar)
- Constructed language with highly regular grammar
- Agglutinative morphology, no grammatical gender, and simple verbal and nominal inflections
	- Verbal suffixes depend on verb being in the infinitive, the participle (active or passive), or three moods (indicative, conditional, or volitive); they do not agree with their subjects
	- Nouns and adjectives only have two cases: nominative and accusative, as well as singular and plural; there is also an adjectival form, which indicates the genitive case (adjectives generally agree with subject in number and form)
	- The accusative case indicates direct objects, but also nouns, adjectives, and adverbs for showing the destination of motion, or to replace propositions; otherwise, the nominative case is used
	- Case system allows for flexible word order, so pragmatic concerns come first ("reflecting information flow")
	- 	Three special letters: ĉ, ĝ, ĥ, ĵ, ŝ, and ŭ; sometimes an acute accent is used to indicate irregular stress in proper names

- The article:
	- Esperanto only has a single defininite article, *la* which is invariable:
		- *La* is used for individual objects, entire classes or types, adjectives used as definite nouns, and may also be used for inalienable possession of body parts and kin terms
			- "Mi trovis botelon kaj deprenis *la* fermilon" -> "I found a bottle and took off *the* lid."
			- "*La* gepardo estas *la* plej rapida el la bestoj." -> "The leopar is the fastest of the animals."
			- "*La* abeloj havas harojn, sed ili ne taŭgas por karesi." -> "The bees have fur, but they are no good for petting."
			- "*La* blua" -> "The blue one."
			- "*La* mia bluas, *la* via ruĝas." -> "Mine is blue, yours is red."
			- "Ili tranĉis *la* manon." -> "They cut off their hands."
- Parts of speech:
	- Esperanto uses the suffixes *-o, -a, -e, and -i* to indicate noun, adjective, adverb, and inifninite
	- Each root word has an inherent part of speech associated with it, nominal, adjcetival, verbal and adverbial. These can be played around with to make different words:
		- e.g., "bela" ("beautiful") can be made into "belo" ("the beautiful"), or "paroli" (to speak) can be made into "parolo" (the act of speech)
		- This can interact particularly with near-synonyms: *brosi* (to brush) and *kombi* (to comb); both have similar meanings, but in their noun form of *broso* and *kombo*, they refer to rather *a brush* and *the act of brushing*
		- Using these two words, we can also the other changes possible, the suffix *-ilo*, which makes tools from verbs; so we get *kombilo* to refer to a comb, and to change a verb *brosi* to a noun we can add the suffix *-ido*, so *brusido* for "the brushing"
		- There is also the undefined -aŭ ending, used across different types of parts-of-speech; most are adverbs, but some have other functions, for example *hodiaŭ* for today, and *ankoraŭ* for yet or still
# Esperanto is not my favorite
(Mainly from https://esperanto.ie/en/esperanto-not-my-favourite-2/)
- Esperanto was officially created in 1887 by Ludwig Lazaros Zamenhof, a resident of Tsarist Poland, who believed that ethnic and cultural conflict could be found language incompatibility
